# ProgrammingFundamentals-and-ObjectOrientedParadigm
All code in Java from my freshman Programming Fundamentals &amp; Object-Oriented Paradigm classes
This code shows a progression of my basic programming skills in the language Java and knowledge of objects throughout my freshman year.
I decided to upload this code to show my improvement from freshman year to the present.
